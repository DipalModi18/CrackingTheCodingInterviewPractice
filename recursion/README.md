# Steps to follow to solve a Recursion problem

- Think about what function should do, not what it currently does.

- Pick a subproblem and assume your function already works on it.
```buildoutcfg
# Get sum of all values from 1...n
function sumTo(n):
    solutionToSubproblem = sumTo(n-1)  
    # We have picked up appropriate subproblem (n-1) and we assumed that the function already works for this subproblem.
```

- Take the answer to your subproblem, and use it to solve for the original problem.  
We already have sumTo(n-1) which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1  
we want to have sumTo(n)   which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-1 + n  
How do we get the sum from 1 to n, if we have the solution from 1 to n-1? Think about it  
```buildoutcfg
function sumTo(n):
    const solutionToSubproblem = sumTo(n-1)
    return solutionToSubproblem + n
```
we took the solution to our subproblem and found how itâ€™s used to solve the original problem. This is known as finding the recurrence

- We need to add base case to stop it  
To pick up a base case, think of the following:  
**What is the _EASIEST POSSIBLE VALUE_ you can put into the function that requies no extra calculation?**
